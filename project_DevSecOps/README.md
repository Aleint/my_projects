# ApiOps & DevSecOps: Automated API Release and Security Scanning in the Cloud

## Project Overview

This project, part of my master's degree thesis, focuses on designing and developing a solution to automate the release and security scanning of APIs in a cloud environment. As the use of APIs continues to grow rapidly, managing large repositories and ensuring the security of exposed endpoints has become a critical challenge for enterprise-level systems.

This project aims to address these challenges by creating an automated ApiOps pipeline that interfaces with a major API Management system (e.g., Microsoft Azure) and integrates a DevSecOps tool for post-release vulnerability analysis. The final solution will contribute to the development and release of secure, well-managed, and compliant APIs in a constantly evolving cloud landscape.


## Key Objectives & Scope

The main goals of this project are:
* To design and build an **automated API release solution** that simplifies the management of large-scale API repositories.
* To integrate **DevSecOps principles** by implementing automated security scanning of APIs after their release to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* To ensure **regulatory compliance** through the extraction and preservation of security scan logs, storing them in immutable WORM (Write-Once, Read-Many) storage.
* To create a flexible, multi-compatible **cloud architecture** capable of supporting the entire release and scanning workflow.
* To address key operational challenges such as **API versioning** and managing deployments across different environments (e.g., development, production).

## Project Phases

The project is structured into the following phases:

1.  **State-of-the-Art Analysis**: A theoretical study of ApiOps in cloud environments and the application of DevSecOps discipline to the API sector.
2.  **Requirements Analysis**: Defining the functional and non-functional requirements of the solution, with a specific focus on automation, multi-cloud compatibility, and distribution in an enterprise cloud environment.
3.  **Architectural Design**: Creating a cloud architecture that supports the release and scanning scenarios, integrating code repositories, and automation/security tools.
4.  **Platform Implementation**: Developing the platform, which includes creating mock APIs, setting up the cloud infrastructure in a lab environment, and automating the ApiOps and security scanning workflows.
5.  **Evaluation and Testing**: Validating the solution in a pilot environment and analyzing the short-term benefits of the automated flow.
6.  **Long-Term Benefit Analysis**: Analyzing and predicting the maturity of a target environment before and after the implementation of the designed model.

## Technology Stack

* **Core Concepts**: ApiOps, DevSecOps, Automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Log Management, Compliance
* **Platforms & Tools**: Microsoft Azure, Azure API Management, Azure DevOps, GitHub/GitLab
